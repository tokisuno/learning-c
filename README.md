# learning-c
I always have the itch to start learning programming again, and this time I want to go wild with C. I am following the K.N. King textbook on C Programming.

*Update: 2024-03-22- Just going to start learning Rust instead. I feel like I am wasting my time doing all of the really tedious stuff that I already know but don't know how to process in C. Rust seems to give more control and really looks like IT for me.
